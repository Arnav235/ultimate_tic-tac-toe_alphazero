# ultimate_tic-tac-toe_alphazero
I used the AlphaZero algorithm to make a bot that plays ultimate tic-tac-toe. 
The trainer.py file trains a model, and saves it to the folder specified, then you can play against in with comp_vs_human

You can find a video of me explaining the project here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CcwC8tTe_QE
